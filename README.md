# Hardening a Containerized Static Site (Flaude) with nginx

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, students will be able to:

1. Serve a static site from a custom nginx Docker container
2. Incrementally apply and verify server-side configurations
3. Use `curl` and browser DevTools to observe and validate HTTP behavior
4. Explain the purpose and tradeoff of each configuration decision
5. Write a minimal but production-realistic `nginx.conf`

---

## Lab Setup

### Project Structure

```
CIS467-SP26-docker-flaude/
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── nginx.conf
├── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── app.js      
│   └── style.css
```

### Base Dockerfile

Students start with this and do not modify it — all changes happen in `nginx.conf`:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY site/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80
```

### Rebuild Helper

You can use this command throughout the lab to build and run your image:

```bash
docker build -t flaude-nginx . && docker run --rm -p 8080:80 flaude-nginx
```

---

## Checkpoint 0 — Baseline (Just Serve Files)

### Goal
Confirm the site loads before any custom configuration is applied.

### nginx.conf

```nginx
events {}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;

    server {
        listen 80;
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/
```

**Expected:** `200 OK`, no special headers, no compression.

### 0.1 - Reflection Question
> What headers does nginx send by default? Are any of them surprising?

> The Last-Modified suprised me as the docker file was made later than the Last-Modified date. I didn't know ETag was for caching either.
```
Server: nginx/1.29.5
Date: Wed, 11 Mar 2026 18:21:48 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 19820
Last-Modified: Mon, 09 Mar 2026 18:24:46 GMT
Connection: keep-alive
ETag: "69af106e-4d6c"
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```
---

## Checkpoint 1 — Compression

### Goal
Reduce asset transfer size for text-based files using gzip.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add inside the `http` block:

```nginx
gzip on;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/javascript application/json;
gzip_min_length 1024;
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" http://localhost:8080/index.js
```

Look for: `Content-Encoding: gzip`

Also verify in browser DevTools → Network tab → select a JS or CSS file →
check the **Response Headers** panel.

### 1.1 Reflection Question
> Why does `gzip_min_length` exist? What's the cost of compressing a 200-byte file?

> To not waste time processing small files that would be faster to just send over the network uncompressed. The cost of compressing a 200-byte file is that even
> if it was to become a 100-byte file, the overhead of the function would not even be made up by the transfer speed.


---

## Checkpoint 2 — Cache Control

### Goal
Apply appropriate caching strategies: aggressive caching for fingerprinted assets,
no caching for HTML entry points.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add inside the `server` block:

```nginx
# HTML — always revalidate
location ~* \.html$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "no-cache, must-revalidate";
}

# Fingerprinted assets — cache for 1 year
location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|woff2|mp4)$ {
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=31536000, immutable";
}
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/index.html
curl -I http://localhost:8080/assets/My_Differential_Equation.cs8Lh0j6.mp4
```
(had to change curl link for mp4, due to it changing in the dist)

Confirm different `Cache-Control` values on each response.

### 2.1 - Reflection Question
> Why would caching `index.html` aggressively be dangerous for a single-page app?
> What would happen if a user's browser cached a stale `index.html` pointing to
> old JS bundles?

> A single-page app would likely change the index.html every single update.
> The old JS bundles might still work, but be unoptimized or actually simply broken due to relying on certain APIs.

---

## Checkpoint 3 — Security Headers

### Goal
Protect users from common browser-level attacks by adding standard security headers.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add inside the `server` block (or a dedicated location):

```nginx
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
add_header Permissions-Policy "geolocation=(), camera=(), microphone=()";
add_header Content-Security-Policy
    "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self';";
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/
```

All five headers should appear in the response.

Also check: https://securityheaders.com (enter `http://localhost:8080` if using
a tunneling tool, or deploy to a VPS for full scoring).

### 3.1 - Reflection Questions
> Break the CSP intentionally — add an inline `<script>` tag to `index.html`
> and observe the browser console error. What does this teach you about
> how CSP is enforced?

> I added an alert script to the index, and it still loaded the page, but the alert did not appear. So it blocked the inline-script while still loading the page.

---

## Checkpoint 4 — SPA Routing Fallback

### Goal
Ensure that client-side routes (e.g., `/dashboard`, `/profile/42`) return
`index.html` instead of a 404, allowing JavaScript frameworks to handle routing.

### Setup

Add a link in `index.html` to a route that has no corresponding HTML file:

```html
<a href="/dashboard">Go to Dashboard</a>
```

Without the fallback, clicking this returns a 404.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Replace or update the default `location` block:

```nginx
location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```

### Verification

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080/dashboard
```

**Expected:** `200 OK` with the content of `index.html` — not a 404.

Also add a custom 404 page to handle truly missing assets:

```nginx
error_page 404 /404.html;
```

### 4.1 - Reflection Questions
> If every route returns `index.html` with a 200, what are the SEO implications?
> How do SSR frameworks like Next.js solve this problem?

---

## Checkpoint 5 — Rate Limiting

### Goal
Protect the server from abusive request patterns using nginx's built-in
rate limiting directives.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

Add to the `http` block:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=general:10m rate=10r/s;
```

Apply it in the `server` block:

```nginx
limit_req zone=general burst=20 nodelay;
limit_req_status 429;
```

### Verification

Use a loop to fire rapid requests:

```bash
for i in $(seq 1 30); do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  http://localhost:8080/; done
```

Some responses should return `429 Too Many Requests` once the burst is exhausted.

### 5.1 - Reflection Question
> Rate limiting on a static site might seem overkill — when would it actually
> matter in production?

---

## Checkpoint 6 — Block Sensitive Paths

### Goal
Prevent accidental exposure of configuration files, version control artifacts,
or environment files that might exist in the container.

### Changes to `nginx.conf`

```nginx
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}

location ~* \.(env|git|yml|yaml|config)$ {
    deny all;
    return 404;
}
```

### Verification

```bash
# Create a test file to block
echo "SECRET=abc123" > site/.env

# Rebuild and test
curl -I http://localhost:8080/.env
```

**Expected:** `404` — not the file contents.

### 6.1 - Reflection Question
> Why return `404` instead of `403 Forbidden`? What information does each
> status code leak to an attacker?

---

## Final nginx.conf

You should have a complete, working config. Review it as a whole and identify any ordering issues or redundancies.

---

## Deliverable: Written Reflection (Individual)

Submit a short written response (200-500 words) answering the following:

1. Which configuration had the most visible impact when you verified it? Why?
2. Choose one header or directive you added. Research what a real-world attack
   looks like that it mitigates, and describe it briefly.
3. What does this lab reveal about what managed hosting platforms like Netlify
   are silently doing on your behalf?
